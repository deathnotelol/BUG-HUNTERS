What is HTML?</h1>
<p>
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML describes the structure of Web pages using markup. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. HTML elements are represented by tags. HTML tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page
