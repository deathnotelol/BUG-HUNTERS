// Assignment
/* Let’s note that an assignment = is also an operator. It is listed in the precedence table with the very low priority of 3. That’s why when we assign a variable, like w = 2 * 2 + 1, then the calculations are done first, and afterwards the = is evaluated, storing the result in w. */
let w = 2 * 2 + 1;
alert( w ); // 5
let a, b, c;
a = b = c = 2 + 2;
alert( a ); // 4
alert( b ); // 4
alert( c ); // 4

let g = 1;
let h = 2;
let i = 3 - (g = h + 1);
alert( g ); // 3
alert( i ); // 0

//Remainder %
/* The remainder operator % despite its look does not have a relation to percents. The result of a % b is the remainder of the integer division of a by b. For instance: */
alert( 5 % 2 ); // 1 is a remainder of 5 divided by 2
alert( 8 % 3 ); // 2 is a remainder of 8 divided by 3
alert( 6 % 3 ); // 0 is a remainder of 6 divided by 3

// Exponentiation **
/* The exponentiation operator ** is a recent addition to the language. For a natural number b, the result of a ** b is a multiplied by itself b times. For instance: */
alert( 2 ** 2 ); // 4  (2 * 2)
alert( 2 ** 3 ); // 8  (2 * 2 * 2)
alert( 2 ** 4 ); // 16 (2 * 2 * 2 * 2)

// The operator works for non-integer numbers of a and b as well, for instance:
alert( 4 ** (1/2) ); // 2 (power of 1/2 is the same as a square root, that's maths)
alert( 8 ** (1/3) ); // 2 (power of 1/3 is the same as a cubic root)

//Increment/decrement
/* Increasing or decreasing a number by one is among the most common numerical operations.So, there are special operators for that: Increment ++ increases a variable by 1: */
let counter = 2;
counter++; // works the same as counter = counter + 1, but is shorter
alert( counter ); // 3

// Decrement -- decreases a variable by 1:
let count = 2;
count--; // works the same as counter = counter - 1, but is shorter
alert( count ); // 1

// This notation can be shortened using operators += and *=:
let n = 2;
n += 5; // now n = 7 (same as n = n + 5)
n *= 2; // now n = 14 (same as n = n * 2)
alert( n ); // 14
