<h2> <b> Code structure </b> </h2>
<p> Statements are delimited with a semicolon: </p>
<script> 
 alert('Hello'); alert('World');
</script>
<p> Usually, a line-break is also treated as a delimiter, so that would also work: </p>
<script>
alert('Hello')
alert('World')
</script>
<p> That’s called “automatic semicolon insertion”. Sometimes it doesn’t work, for instance: </p>
<script>
alert("There will be an error after this message")
[1, 2].forEach(alert)
</script>
<p> Most codestyle guides agree that we should put a semicolon after each statement. Semicolons are not required after code blocks {...} and syntax constructs with them like loops: </p> <br>
function f() { <br>
  // no semicolon needed after function declaration  <br>
} <br>
for(;;) { <br>
  // no semicolon needed after the loop <br>
} <br>
<P> But even if we can put an “extra” semicolon somewhere, that’s not an error. It will be ignored. More in: Code structure. </P>
<h2> Strict mode </h2>
<p> To fully enable all features of modern JavaScript, we should start scripts with "use strict". </p> <br>
'use strict'; <br>
<h2> <b> Variables </b> </h2>
Can be declared using:
<ul> 
  <li> let </li>
  <li> const (constant, can’t be changed) </li>
  <li> var (old-style, will see later) </li>
</ul>
There are 7 data types:
<ul>
  <li> number for both floating-point and integer numbers, </li>
  <li> string for strings, </li>
  <li> boolean for logical values: true/false, </li>
  <li> null – a type with a single value null, meaning “empty” or “does not exist”, </li>
  <li> undefined – a type with a single value undefined, meaning “not assigned”, </li>
  <li> object and symbol – for complex data structures and unique identifiers, we haven’t learnt them yet. </li>
</ul>
<h2> <b> Interaction </b> </h2>
<p> We’re using a browser as a working environment, so basic UI functions will be: prompt(question[, default])
Ask a question, and return either what the visitor entered or null if they pressed “cancel”. confirm(question)
Ask a question and suggest to choose between Ok and Cancel. The choice is returned as true/false. alert(message)
Output a message. All these functions are modal, they pause the code execution and prevent the visitor from interacting with the page until they answer. For instance: </p>
<script>
let userName = prompt("Your name?", "Alice");
let isTeaWanted = confirm("Do you want some tea?");
alert( "Visitor: " + userName ); // Alice
alert( "Tea wanted: " + isTeaWanted ); // true
</script> 
<h2> <b> Arithmetical </b> </h2>
<p> Regular: * + - /, also % for the remainder and ** for power of a number. The binary plus + concatenates strings. And if any of the operands is a string, the other one is converted to string too:
<script>
alert( '1' + 2 ); // '12', string
alert( 1 + '2' ); // '12', string
</script>
<b> Assignments </b>
<p> There is a simple assignment: a = b and combined ones like a *= 2. </p>
<b> Bitwise </b>
<p> Bitwise operators work with integers on bit-level: see the docs when they are needed. </p>
<b> Ternary </b>
<P> The only operator with three parameters: cond ? resultA : resultB. If cond is truthy, returns resultA, otherwise resultB. </P>
<b> Logical operators </b>
<p> Logical AND && and OR || perform short-circuit evaluation and then return the value where it stopped. </p>
<b> Comparisons </b>
<p> Equality check == for values of different types converts them to a number (except null and undefined that equal each other and nothing else), so these are equal: </p>
<script>
alert( 0 == false ); // true
alert( 0 == '' ); // true
</script> 
<p> Other comparisons convert to a number as well. The strict equality operator === doesn’t do the conversion: different types always mean different values for it, so: Values null and undefined are special: they equal == each other and don’t equal anything else. Greater/less comparisons compare strings character-by-character, other types are converted to a number.
<b> Logical operators </b>
<p> There are few others, like a comma operator. More in: Operators, Comparisons, Logical operators.</p>
<h2> <b> Loops </b> </h2>
We covered 3 types of loops: <br>
// 1 <br>
while (condition) { <br>
  ... <br>
} <br>
// 2 <br>
do { <br>
  ... <br>
} while (condition); <br>
// 3 <br>
for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) { <br>
  ... <br>
} <br>
<p> The variable declared in for(let...) loop is visible only inside the loop. But we can also omit let and reuse an existing variable. Directives break/continue allow to exit the whole loop/current iteration. Use labels to break nested loops. Details in: Loops: while and for. Later we’ll study more types of loops to deal with objects. The “switch” construct can replace multiple if checks. It uses === (strict equality) for comparisons. </p>
<script> 
 let age = prompt('Your age?', 18);
switch (age) {
  case 18:
    alert("Won't work"); // the result of prompt is a string, not a number

  case "18":
    alert("This works!");
    break;
  default:
    alert("Any value not equal to one above");
} 
</script>
<h2> <b> Functions </b> </h2>
<p> We covered three ways to create a function in JavaScript: Function Declaration: the function in the main code flow </p>
<script>
function sum(a, b) {
  let result = a + b;
  return result;
}
//Function Expression: the function in the context of an expression </p>
let sum = function(a, b) {
  let result = a + b;
  return result;
}
// Function expressions can have a name, like sum = function name(a, b), but that name is only visible inside that function.
//Arrow functions:
// expression at the right side
let sum = (a, b) => a + b;
// or multi-line syntax with { ... }, need return here:
let sum = (a, b) => {
  // ...
  return a + b;
}
// without arguments
let sayHi = () => alert("Hello");
// with a single argument
let double = n => n * 2;
</script> 
<p> Functions may have local variables: those declared inside its body. Such variables are only visible inside the function. Parameters can have default values: function sum(a = 1, b = 2) {...}. Functions always return something. If there’s no return statement, then the result is undefined. </p>
