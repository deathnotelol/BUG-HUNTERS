<p> The break labelName statement in the loop breaks out to the label. Like here: </p>
<script>
	outer: for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
	for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
    let input = prompt(`Value at coords (${i},${j})`, '');
    // if an empty string or canceled, then break out of both loops
    if (!input) break outer; // (*)
    // do something with the value...
  	}
}
alert('Done!');
</script> 
<h2> <b> Summary </b> </h2>
<p> We covered 3 types of loops: </p>
<ul> 
	<li> while – The condition is checked before each iteration. </li>
	<li> do..while – The condition is checked after each iteration. </li>
	<li> for (;;) – The condition is checked before each iteration, additional settings available. </li>
<p> To make an “infinite” loop, usually the while(true) construct is used. Such a loop, just like any other, can be stopped with the break directive.If we don’t want to do anything on the current iteration and would like to forward to the next one, the continue directive does it. break/continue support labels before the loop. A label is the only way for break/continue to escape the nesting and go to the outer loop.</p>
