alert("Comparisons Many comparison operators we know from maths: Greater/less than: a > b, a < b. Greater/less than or equals: a >= b, a <= b. Equality check is written as a == b (please note the double equation sign =. A single symbol a = b would mean an assignment). Not equals. In maths the notation is ≠, in JavaScript it’s written as an assignment with an exclamation sign before it: a != b.");
// Boolean is the result 
/* Just as all other operators, a comparison returns a value. The value is of the boolean type. true – means “yes”, “correct” or “the truth”. false – means “no”, “wrong” or “a lie”. */
// For example:
alert( 2 > 1 );  // true (correct)
alert( 2 == 1 ); // false (wrong)
alert( 2 != 1 ); // true (correct)
let result = 5 > 4; // assign the result of the comparison
alert( result ); // true

<h2> Summary </h2>
<p> Comparison operators return a logical value. Strings are compared letter-by-letter in the “dictionary” order. When values of different types are compared, they get converted to numbers (with the exclusion of a strict equality check). Values null and undefined equal == each other and do not equal any other value. Be careful when using comparisons like > or < with variables that can occasionally be null/undefined. Making a separate check for null/undefined is a good idea. </p>
