<title> JS Conditional Operators </title>
<body>
<b> The “if” statement </b>
<p> The if statement gets a condition, evaluates it and, if the result is true, executes the code. </p>
<script> 
let year = prompt('In which year was ECMAScript-2015 specification published?', '');
if (year == 2015) alert( 'You are right!' );
</script>
<h2> <b> The “else” clause </b> </h2>
<p> The if statement may contain an optional “else” block. It executes when the condition is wrong. </p>
<script>
	let love = prompt('Love is 1500?', '');
	if (love == 1500) {
  	alert( 'You are right now!' );
	} 
	else {
  	alert( 'Wrong Answer' ); // any value except 2015
	}
</script>
<h2> <b> Several conditions: “else if” </b> </h2>
<p> Sometimes we’d like to test several variants of a condition. There is an else if clause for that. </p>
<script> 
 let years = prompt('In which year was ECMAScript-2015 specification published?', '');
	if (years < 2015) 
	{
  		alert( 'Too early...' );
	}
	else if (years > 2015) 
	{
  		alert( 'Too late' );
	} 
	else 
	{
  		alert( 'Exactly!' );
	}
</script>
<h2> <b> Ternary operator ‘?’ </b> </h2>
<p> Sometimes we need to assign a variable depending on a condition. For instance: </p>
<script> 
	let accessAllowed;
	let lol = prompt('How old are you?', '');
		if (lol > 18) {
  	accessAllowed = true;
	} 
		else {
  accessAllowed = false;
	}
	alert(accessAllowed);
</script>
<h2> <b> Multiple ‘?’ </b> </h2>
<p> A sequence of question mark ? operators allows returning a value that depends on more than one condition. For instance: </p>
<script>
	let baby = prompt('age?', 18);
	let message = (baby < 3) ? 'Hi, baby!' :
  		(baby < 18) ? 'Hello!' :
  		(baby < 100) ? 'Greetings!' :
  		'What an unusual age!';
	alert( message );
</script>
<h2> <b> Non-traditional use of ‘?’ </b> </h2>
<p> Sometimes the question mark ? is used as a replacement for if: </p>
<script>
	let company = prompt ('Which company created JavaScript?', '');
	(company == 'Netscape') ?
  	alert('Right!') : alert('Wrong.');
